# Universal Design

## What is Universal Design?
Universal design is defined as “the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability”. This involves considering users of all backgrounds and capability from the very beginning of design, which differs from assistive technology that can be implemented after-the-fact to help certain groups of users. 

## 7 Guiding principles of Universal Design

The 7 Principles of Universal Design were set forth by a team led by Robert Mace at North Carolina State University to guide the design of environments, products, and communications in a way that considers all potential users. These principles are
1.	Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities
2.	Flexibility in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities
3.	Simple and Intuitive Use: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level
4.	Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities
5.	Tolerance for Error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions
6.	Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue
7.	Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility
By following these principles, designers can make their designs accessible to more potential users from the beginning, creating better solutions and possibly eliminating the need for supplemental assistive technology after the design has been implemented, which simplifies things for the user and can also help reduce expenses.
Perhaps the best way to understand these principles is in action. The following video does a great job demonstrating how these principles have been applied to the design of Ed Roberts Campus in Berkeley, California, showing how universal design can make a real difference.

## What does Universal Design look like?

The Ed Roberts Campus is one great example but it is far from the only example of universal design. We can all identify examples of universal design in our daily lives.

Consider automatic doors. At grocery stores, shopping malls, offices, and so many public spaces, automatic doors have created a contact-free solution to something than many people take for granted: entering and exiting a building. However, for many people with physical impairments, entering and exiting a building cannot be taken for granted. While automatic doors make things easier for all of us, they have perhaps especially helped those who have difficulty opening a traditional door. This is a prime example of universal design since ease of use for people of all abilities is baked into the design itself.

Like entering and exiting a building, crossing a street is another routine action that many of us don’t think twice about. We simply look both ways and look at the crosswalk sign, and cross when it is clear. However, for someone with serious visual impairments (ex: blindness), crossing a street is far more difficult and far more dangerous. Some new crosswalk designs, including the ones here at Hopkins, not only include the traditional visual crosswalk sign but also include auditory cues, with a speaker stating “Walk sign is on for crossing” when it is safe to walk or calling out “Wait” when it is unsafe and someone is about to cross. This design makes it easier for such users to cross the street safely and can also help other users with perfect vision who simply might not be paying attention.

As the world around us grows increasingly digital, universal design becomes even more important. From communication to entertainment, to shopping and even to everyday tasks around the house with smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets becoming increasingly popular, so much of what we do has shifted to our personal electronic devices. With so much being done on these devices, smart assistants like Siri and Google Assistant on our mobile phones aim to make it easier and faster to accomplish such tasks. Taking a closer look at these assistants, universal design is at their core. While interacting with a screen of any sort may be difficult for those with visual impairments, being able to accomplish the same tasks just as quickly and easily with voice interaction can be game-changing for such users. On the flip side, while voice interaction may allow for easier and faster interaction for such users and many fully able users in general, it can be very difficult for those with hearing impediments (ex: deafness) to reap the same benefits. However, these assistants also accept text-based queries and provide both auditory and text/visual feedback, an important design choice that not only helps those with hearing impediments, but also helps many fully able users who may simply prefer to enter a text query or may want to refer to the assistant’s response on screen to ensure they did not mishear.

## Closing Thoughts

As technology continues to advance, universal design will be increasingly important to ensure that no groups of people get left behind by further innovation. As the examples discussed highlight, universal design is not exclusive to any particular field, but rather should be adopted in any field or industry where design is involved. By carefully considering the 7 principles and applying universal design, designers can create innovative solutions that can seamlessly be used by people of all backgrounds, ages, and abilities.
